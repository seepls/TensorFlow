Basically redis forms an in-memory persistence layer for websockets. So it stores the information 
about the clients to which websocket connection is currently 
open and for HTTP long polling, it stores the client info until it is time to expire.
If we are going to use a socketIO server with express, why do we going to need redis? Just to maintain the list of clients right?
Instead of that, lets subscribe the users to a particular channel based on the view-state of the frontend.
We are going to use sockets to deliver realtime updates of incident reports.
So, instead of pushing the message to each client, lets create channels based on their geo-spatial location
i.e. we are going to have separate channels for lets say kanpur & delhi.
