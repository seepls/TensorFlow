tensor flow serving is a flexible , high performance serving system for ML models , designed for production environments .
tensorflow serving makes it easy to deploy new algorithms and experiments. while keeping same server architecture and APIs.
Tensorflow serving provides integration with tensorflow models .can be extended to serve other types of models and data .


Servables 
central abstraction in tf serving .underlying objects that clients use to perform computation .[ look up or inference ]
Servable 
- single shard of a look up table 
- single model 
- tuple of inference models

typical servables include :
tensorflow SavedModelBundle (tensorflow :: session )
lookup table for embedding or vocabulary look ups
